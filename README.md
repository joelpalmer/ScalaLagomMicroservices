Microservices using Scala and Lagom starting point. 

Original code from http://blog.scalac.io/2016/07/14/lagom-scala.html

Be sure to point your bash profile at java 8. 

I've added a Postman collection for the requests. The blog post is great but has a couple
errors in it as far as the requests. They are correct in the Postman collection. 

### Todo

- [ ] Create a boilerplate out of this
- [ ] Create an intelliJ project template out of this
- [ ] Create a real-word-ish project with this as boilerplate/starter
- [ ] deep dive in to Lagom
- [ ] Enjoy the Scala goodness
